# Decision Making With Matrices

# This is a pretty simple assignment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations. 

# The problem is: you and your work friends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a restaurant thatâ€™s best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so everyone is happier.  

# Despite the simplicity of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.
  
# This process was thoroughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approach can prove helpful on any number of decision making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.

For each person, we will multiply the corresponding category for each restaurant, by the weight assigned to that value. We will then summ those values to reach each persons score for a particular

"""
There is a difference between the two because one is based on the raw scores obtained via weights of the survery results, and the other is based on an ordinal ranking system.
While the raw score takes into account the magnitude of each characteristic, it is vulnerable to outliers, which can cause skewness.
In contrast, the ordinal ranking system is not vulnerable to outliers, but does not take into account the magnitude of score difference.
In the real world, this represents the idea that not all features of a restaruant are equally important, or similarly important to different people.

I would recommend a log transform for this particular data set because it would reduce skewness and the potential effects of any outliers.
